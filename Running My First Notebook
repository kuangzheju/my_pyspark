Running your first notebook will test your software setup and environment.

If it is not already running, start the Virtual Machine by issuing issue the command "vagrant up" from a DOS prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux).
You should have already downloaded and unzipped the master.zip file in the module "Downloading and installing the virtual machine".  The zip file contains the file "lab0_student.ipynb" that you will need in step #4.  You can view a read-only online version of the Spark iPython notebook here.
Once the Virtual Machine is running, access the Jupyter web UI for running IPython notebooks by navigating your web browser to "http://localhost:8001" (or "http://127.0.0.1:8001/").
On the Jupyter web page, use the Upload button to upload the "lab0_student.ipynb" Spark iPython notebook file that was mentioned in step #2.
Select the file and run each cell - verify that you do not encounter any errors. 
At the end of the notebook, instructions are included on how to export the notebook as a Python (.py) file and to submit that file to the autograder.
The following videos walk you through the steps of running your first notebook.

it essentially is a python in my browser!!!
